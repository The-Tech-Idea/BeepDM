# Editor Layer

The Editor layer provides high-level orchestration and management services for data operations within the BeepDM framework. It acts as a coordination layer between data sources, managing complex workflows like ETL operations, data synchronization, mapping, and unit of work patterns.

## Core Components

### Data Management
- **DMEEditor**: Central orchestrator for all data management operations
- **DataImportManager**: Handles data import workflows and validation
- **DataSyncManager**: Manages data synchronization between sources
- **MappingManager**: Handles field mapping and data transformation definitions

### Unit of Work Pattern
- **UnitofWork**: Basic unit of work implementation for transaction-like operations
- **UnitOfWorkFactory**: Factory for creating unit of work instances
- **UnitofWorksManager**: Manages multiple unit of work instances
- **UnitOfWorkWrapper**: Provides additional abstraction over unit of work
- **MultiDataSourceUnitOfWork**: Coordinates operations across multiple data sources

### ETL and Processing
- **ETLEditor**: ETL pipeline configuration and execution management
- **BatchExtensions**: Utility extensions for batch processing operations
- **EntityDataMoveValidator**: Validates data movement operations
- **DefaultsManager**: Manages default values and field population

## Key Features

### Transaction Management
- Unit of work pattern implementation
- Multi-data source transaction coordination
- Rollback and commit capabilities

### Data Processing
- ETL pipeline management
- Batch processing utilities
- Data validation and transformation
- Field mapping and defaults

### Synchronization
- Change tracking
- Conflict resolution
- Multi-directional sync

## Architecture

The Editor layer follows a manager pattern where each major concern (import, sync, mapping, etc.) has a dedicated manager class. These managers coordinate with the underlying data sources through the IDataSource interface while providing higher-level abstractions for complex operations.

## Usage Patterns

1. **Simple Operations**: Use DMEEditor directly for basic CRUD operations
2. **Complex Workflows**: Use specialized managers (DataImportManager, ETLEditor)
3. **Transactional Work**: Wrap operations in UnitofWork instances
4. **Batch Processing**: Use BatchExtensions for efficient bulk operations
