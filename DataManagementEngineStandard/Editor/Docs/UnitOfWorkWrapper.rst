UnitOfWorkWrapper
=================

.. class:: UnitOfWorkWrapper

   Provides an additional abstraction layer over Unit of Work instances, adding cross-cutting concerns and enhanced functionality.

   Responsibilities
   ----------------
   - Wraps UnitofWork instances with additional functionality
   - Provides logging, monitoring, and instrumentation
   - Handles automatic retry and error recovery
   - Adds validation and business rule enforcement
   - Manages caching and performance optimizations

   Key Methods
   -----------
   - Wrap(): Wraps existing UnitofWork with additional functionality
   - Execute(): Executes operations with wrapper enhancements
   - AddInterceptor(): Adds operation interceptors
   - GetWrappedUnitOfWork(): Accesses underlying UnitofWork
   - Configure(): Configures wrapper behavior

   Typical Flow
   ------------
   1. Create or receive UnitofWork instance
   2. Wrap with UnitOfWorkWrapper for enhancements
   3. Configure desired wrapper behaviors (logging, retry, etc.)
   4. Execute operations through wrapper
   5. Wrapper coordinates with underlying UnitofWork

   Extension Points
   ----------------
   - Custom interceptor implementations
   - Pluggable retry strategies
   - Configurable validation rules
   - Performance monitoring hooks
   - Custom caching strategies
