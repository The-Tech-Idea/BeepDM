MappingManager
==============

.. class:: MappingManager

   Manages field mappings and data transformations between different data sources and entities.

   Responsibilities
   ----------------
   - Defines and manages field-to-field mappings
   - Handles data type conversions and transformations
   - Manages mapping templates and reusable configurations
   - Validates mapping integrity and compatibility
   - Applies transformations during data operations

   Key Methods
   -----------
   - CreateMapping(): Creates new field mappings
   - ApplyTransformation(): Applies transformation rules to data
   - ValidateMapping(): Ensures mapping compatibility
   - SaveMappingTemplate(): Persists reusable mapping configurations
   - GetFieldMapping(): Retrieves field mapping information

   Typical Flow
   ------------
   1. Analyze source and destination schemas
   2. Create field mappings with transformation rules
   3. Validate mapping compatibility
   4. Save mapping configuration for reuse
   5. Apply mappings during data operations

   Extension Points
   ----------------
   - Custom transformation functions
   - Mapping validation rules
   - Schema analysis algorithms
   - Template storage mechanisms
