DataSyncManager
===============

.. class:: DataSyncManager

   Manages data synchronization operations between multiple data sources, handling change detection and conflict resolution.

   Responsibilities
   ----------------
   - Detects changes in source data since last sync
   - Manages bidirectional and unidirectional sync operations
   - Handles conflict resolution during sync
   - Tracks sync history and metadata
   - Coordinates incremental and full sync operations

   Key Methods
   -----------
   - GetChanges(): Retrieves changes since last sync point
   - SyncChanges(): Applies changes to destination sources
   - ResolveConflicts(): Handles data conflicts during sync
   - CreateSyncPoint(): Establishes synchronization checkpoints
   - GetSyncStatus(): Reports current sync operation status

   Typical Flow
   ------------
   1. Establish sync configuration and endpoints
   2. Detect changes since last sync point
   3. Apply conflict resolution rules
   4. Synchronize changes to destinations
   5. Update sync checkpoints

   Extension Points
   ----------------
   - Custom conflict resolution strategies
   - Change detection algorithms
   - Sync filtering and transformation rules
   - Progress monitoring hooks
