# Importing Examples

## Purpose
This folder provides practical examples for building and running import jobs with progress tracking and error handling.

## Key Files
- `DataImportManagerExamples.cs`: Sample import orchestration scenarios.
- `ImportProgressTracker` (in the same file): Demonstrates progress event handling and status output.

## How To Use
1. Build a `DataImportConfiguration` for source and target entities.
2. Run import examples with validation and transformation enabled.
3. Inspect generated logs and performance summaries.

## Extension Guidelines
- Keep sample mappings simple and explicit.
- Use these examples as a baseline for integration tests.
