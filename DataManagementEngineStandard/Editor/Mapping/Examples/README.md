# Mapping Examples

## Purpose
This folder contains usage examples for AutoObjMapper configuration and object mapping execution.

## Key Files
- `AutoObjMapperExamples.cs`: Example mappings, including simple DTO/model pairs (`PersonDto`, `Person`).

## How To Use
1. Configure a map with property-level rules.
2. Execute mapping and inspect mapped results.
3. Expand examples with nested and collection mappings for regression tests.

## Extension Guidelines
- Keep examples aligned with current fluent APIs.
- Prefer small examples that can be reused directly in unit tests.
