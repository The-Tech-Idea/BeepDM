# DataView

View-oriented datasource support.

## Key Files
- `DataViewConnection.cs`: connection representation for data-view workflows.
- `DataViewDataSource.cs`: datasource implementation for view data.

## How It Fits
Supports projection/read workflows where a data-view abstraction is preferred over direct table/entity handling.
